         <i>These are the programs I have created, that I am very proud of!</i>
         <br><br>
        <h3><u>Visual Basic</u> :-</h3>
        <br>
         - Created program for MS Access for Security Control operators to track, dispatch and document alarm responses from
        other alarm monitoring companies. PODS (Patrol Officer Dispatch System) was utalised by 4 Security Companies - 
        that I know of!
        <br><br>
         - Created program for MS Access for a Prize Fulfilment Database for The Lottery Corporation, tracking the prizes
         and prize claims for Promotional Prize winners (still utalised) with automatic correspondence creator.
         <br><br>
         - Created program for MS Access to simplify sending recurring emails for The Lottery Corporation. This program creates,
         addresses, adds subject line, adds content and signature of user, in one click.
         <br><br>
         - Created program for MS Excel to track and check the Lottery Draws for Australia against the Gaming System used by
         The Lottery Corporation (still utalised), with features such as auto report generating, dividend calculation, auto phone
          calls, advertising content creation, all at the click of a button.
          <br><br>
         <h3><u>Python</u> :-</h3> 
         <br>
          - Created a Python Script for The Lottery Corporation to emulate Lucky Lotto Draws to simulate and find out the maximum 
          number of draws held before the Jackpot Prize would be won, based on statistics. This script is still utalised when the 
          bigwigs get nervous as the Jackpot prize starts going above $40 - $50 Million.
          <br><br>
          <h3><u>MQL4</u> :-</h3> 
          <br>
           - Created an Indicator that changes the chart symbol of the current active chart, highlighting which currency pair it is.
           This indicator also checks for any open or pending trades for each symbol and displays that information.
           <br><br>
           - Created an Expert Adviser (Robot) that places trades for signals provided that puts a pending order on <u>(with trailing 
           entry, a feature NOT available in the MetaTrader 4 Platform)</u> then converts the pending order to a live order and 
           displays real time data on all orders placed for <i>any</i> symbol, all on one chart. All displayed symbol pairs
           are also links to change the current chart symbol.
           <br><br>
            - Created an Expert Advisor (Robot) that tracks and manages trades per specific indicators on the chart. This robot tracks all
            current orders, for all currency pairs, from one chart. This program exits trades when the conditions are met.
